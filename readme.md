# Laravel 4 Oracle (OCI8) Database Support

Laravel-OCI8
============

This project was a fork of a dead project that i tried to make working, it worked for a while but i never tested it in production.

Recently, a new fork was made and i can see this person is really maintaining it, at least more than me, thus i recommend that you switch to his version:

https://github.com/yajra/laravel-oci8

Good luck and have fun everyone...
